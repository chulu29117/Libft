###
1. echo '$'$'$'$'$'
Not handling


### 
2. >| echo sure (not a syntax error????)

>| (No Space): Noclobber Override Operator
>| is a single redirection operator that overrides the noclobber option in bash:

This is interpreted as:
Execute echo sure as a command
If the noclobber option is set (set -o noclobber), 
override it and allow output redirection to overwrite files
The error you see (Command 'sure' not found) occurs because bash is trying to execute sure as a program,
with echo being the file to redirect to.

###
3. cat << hello
$USER
$NOVAR
$HOME
hello

Issue fixed: can now also take single quoted delimiter --> don't expand.
Only expand input when unquoted.

$NOVAR
should do nothing (eve suggests that in parsing if it doesn't find a value it can be replaced with spaces, that'll make the shell do nothing)
###
4. /bin/echo $'HOM'E$USER do double quotes
Fixed
